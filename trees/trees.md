# Trees
 - a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship
- lists are linear, trees are nonlinear (they can branch)

## Terminology
- Root is the top node in a tree
- Child is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- Parent - the converse notion of a child
- Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf a node with no children
- Edge - the connection between one node and another

## Tree Applications

- HTML DOM (document object model)
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Trees
- Artificial Intelligence
- Computer File Systems
- JSON (javascript object notation)

## Binary Search Trees

- binary search trees
- sorted in an order
- each node can have at most 2 children
- every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- every node to the right of a parent node if always greater than the parent

## Big O of BST
- insertion - O(log n)
- searching - O(log n)
