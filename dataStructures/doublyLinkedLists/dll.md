# Doubly Linked Lists

- almost identical to SLL. except every node has another pointer, to the previous node.
- more flexibility than SLL, but it uses more memory




# Big O of DOuble Linked Lists

- insertion - O(1)
- removal - O(1)
- searching O(N)
- access - O(N)

## Recap

- DLL almost identical to SLL except ther is an additional pointer to the previous nodes
- better than SLL for finding nodes and can be done in half the time
- they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
