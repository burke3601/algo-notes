# Data Structures

Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.


## ES 2015 Class Syntax Review

Primarily syntactical sugar over JS existing prototype based inheritance (not true OOP)
Class - a blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods



keyword `this` refers to the object created from that class(aka an instance)

## Recap
- classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances
- classes are created with the new keyword
- the constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
- instance methods can be added to classes similair to methods in objects
- class methods can be added using the static keyword
