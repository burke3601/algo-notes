# Recursion
- a process(a function) that calls itself
- JSON.parse/Json.stringify are recursive
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
- object traversal
- we will see it more complex data structures
- it's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration



## Call Stack
- it's a stack data structure
- any time a function is invoked it is places (pushed) on the top of the call stack
- when JS sees the return keyword or when the funcion ends, the compiler will remove (pop)


## Things to look out for

- no base case
- forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing
- stack overflow
