# Problem Solving

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

- understand the problem
    1. can I restate the problem in my own words?
    2. what are the inputs?
    3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution?
    4. can outputs be determined from the inputs?
    5. how should i lablem pieces of data?
- explore concrete examples
    - start simple
    - move to more complex
    - edge cases
    - empty inputs
    - invalid inputs
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- look back and refactor
    - can you check the result?
    - can you derive the result differently?
    - can you understand it at a glance?
    - can you use the reslt or method for some other problem?
    - can you improve the performance of your solution?
    - can you think of other ways to refactor?
    - how have other people solved this problem?
