# Arrays 

- use when you need order

## Big O 
- insertion - it depends... (would have to reindex certain indexes)
- removal - it depends...
- searching - O(n)
- access - O(1)

- push and pop are more efficient than shift and unshift

## Array Methods

Constant time: push, pop
Linear time: shift, unshift, concat, slice, splice, forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc.
O(N * log N) : sort
